=== The_Archivists ===
What does it mean to worship digital decay? Perhaps they try and find meaning in entropy? The decay of digital systems could be seen as fate. The random particles that flip bits. They observe the decay and try to spot meaning.

The archivists are not truly sinister, but the decay they observe has sinister undertones.

The player will have the option of approaching conversations in a lot of different ways, getting different information and possible assistance. The player will also have the option of exploring the archive, and robbing the archivists.
